						 <h2>Sobre:</h2>
						  <p>Kagami Tsurugi just arrived in Paris. An excellent fencer, she has a great sense of honor and a strong will to succeed in everything she does.
						She probably takes after her mother, Tomoe, who is as demanding of her as Gabriel Agreste is of his son.
						Kagami has powerful feelings for Adrien, but also for Marinette, who has become her friend.
						Kagami is the holder of the Miraculous of the dragon, which grants the power of perfection.
						With the help of her kwami Longg, she transforms into Ryûko.</p>
